#Insert Name Here
Website that showcases different restaurant/cafe locations with photos of aesthetics and whatnot inside; each location has short desc. and certain tags(i.e sunset, sunrise, late night, etc)

##Ideas:
-Rating System: how accurate the desc and images are/ comments on location for other users
-Form/Button to let admin know if location has changed
-Query search: specific locations, general type(i.e cafe, restaurant, fast food), tags
-Do we want a user to be able to upload a place? Or do we want a way to submit a location with user images so admin can screen?
